# RALPH_SUPERVISED_CMD (default empty) is a caller-configured command that

# is a directory-prefix match (`lib/leads/` matches `lib/leads/foo.mjs`),
# anything else is an exact-file match (`api/lead-action.ts` matches only

# the manifest is produced, only how to run it and read its output.
#
# RALPH_SUPERVISED_CMD unset → not supervised. This is deliberate: it is

# docs/ai/learned-rules.jsonl: a wrong park teaches a wrong rule. Quoting the
# model's own words verbatim in reconcile_issue step 4 makes that
# misattribution impossible — the harness's guess becomes a clearly-labelled
# secondary note, never the headline reason.
#
# Truncated (RALPH_BLOCKED_REASON_MAX_CHARS) and blockquoted for embedding in

# After a Ralph PR merges, confirm its linked issue ACTUALLY closed — and close
# it if GitHub's linkage silently failed. ops#305.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE PRIMARY DEFENCE, not a backstop. ops#305 framed the cause as a
# breakable reference: `Closes **#44**`, or the middot list
# `Closes #186 · #187 · #188 · #191 · #196` that lost three issues in PR #311.
# Both are real. But on 2026-09-16 PR #360 carried a clean, bare `Closes #297`
# on its own line, based on the default branch, merged — and #297 stayed open.
# Correct syntax is not sufficient, so a pre-merge body check cannot be the
# primary mechanism. Only verifying the transition afterwards catches a failure
# whose syntax was already right.
#
# THE SAFETY GUARD. A merged PR does NOT imply a finished issue —
# reconcile_issue's step 6 exists precisely because merged work often leaves a
# remainder. So this closes only when the PR body carries a closing keyword
# naming THIS issue, and only on the keyword's own line, so a passing mention
# elsewhere ("see #126 for the rest") is never mistaken for intent. It repairs a
# linkage the author expressed; it never invents one.
#
# Fails safe at every step: an unreadable PR, an unparseable branch, a
# non-MERGED state or an unknown issue state all return without closing.

# needs-adrian as before so nothing auto-proceeds. A human reviews, folds it

# "- " bullets out of the body (Proposal/plan lines often already state the

  # 3) Deliberate stop vs genuine failure. "No branch pushed" is ambiguous: the
  #    model may have crashed/timed out (a real failed attempt → retry), OR it
  #    followed prompt.md §1 ("blocked/ambiguous → comment and STOP") and pushed
  #    nothing ON PURPOSE because the issue needs a human. Burning an attempt on
  #    the latter double-counts one decision and wastes the retry on an
  #    already-known blocker (site-engine#86: a schema-drift blocker cost an
  #    attempt and reddened the run, halting the chain). Distinguish via the
  #    model's own signals, each gated to THIS cycle so a re-queue resets them:
  #      (a) a `ralph-blocked` comment it posted — the PRIMARY signal, because
  #          §1 makes it always comment when it stops (a label add is optional
  #          and a cautious model may skip it), or
  #      (b) the issue left the ready queue mid-run — closed, ready label
  #          pulled, or needs-adrian/blocked added (by the model or a human).
  #    Either routes to a human (needs-adrian) GREEN with no attempt recorded.
  #    On a gh API failure eligibility defaults to "queued" and the sentinel to
  #    absent → conservative fall-through to the attempt path, never a silent
